# 💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m Paolo Strianese, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Milan-Bicocca and a full-stack developer. I first got interested in applying computer vision to agriculture through my thesis, where I worked on automation in viticulture. Since then, I’ve been working on projects ranging from backend to frontend, collaborating with companies like Accenture, Enel, and Amaris.<br>I enjoy taking part in hackathons, I’m curious and always looking for new challenges, especially in robotics, artificial intelligence, and their real-world applications. I’d love to keep exploring these areas, ideally through projects that combine technology, automation, and sustainability.
